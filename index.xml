      <description>Handy links for GIT Git is an amazing tool for collaborative projects. In a nutshell, it enables version controlling of whatever collection of digital you log in it. When writing a paper with other people, it makes it easy to trace changes, ensure everyone can reach the most recent version of the text / code / experiments, and revert back in time to restore previous versions, if needed. As a PhD student, if you want to do research with me, knowing how to navigate git is a prerequisite.</description>

      <description>This post contains some common Q&amp;amp;A for PhD students:
Q: Am I allowed to submit the same paper to multiple venues? A: In general NO, not simultaneously. The large majority of the conferences and journals in our filed only accept original works (i.e., papers that do not have large overlap with existing work). If your paper is rejected from venue1, of course you can submit (an improved version) to venue2, after you receive the final notification of rejection.</description>

      <description>This paper proposes Yggdrasil, a protocol for privacy-aware dual data deduplication in multi client settings. Yggdrasil is designed to reduce the cloud storage space while safeguarding the privacy of the client’s outsourced data. Yggdrasil combines three innovative tools to achieve this goal. First, generalized deduplication, an emerging technique to reduce data footprint. Second, non-deterministic transformations that are described compactly and improve the degree of data compression in the Cloud (across users).</description>

      <title>Where are you Bob? Privacy-Preserving Proximity Testing with a Napping Party</title>

      <description>Location based services (LBS) extensively utilize proximity testing to help people discover nearby friends, devices, and services. Current practices rely on full trust to the service providers: users share their locations with the providers who perform proximity testing on behalf of the users. Unfortunately, location data has been often breached by LBS providers, raising privacy concerns over the current practices. To address these concerns previous research has suggested cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving location proximity testing.</description>

      <title>Secure Generalized Deduplication via Multi-Key Revealing Encryption</title>

      <description>Cloud Storage Providers (CSPs) offer solutions to relieve users from locally storing vast amounts of data, including personal and sensitive ones. While users may desire to retain some privacy on the data they outsource, CSPs are interested in reducing the total storage space by employing compression techniques such as deduplication. We propose a new cryptographic primitive that simultaneously realizes both requirements: Multi-Key Revealing Encryption (MKRE). The goal of MKRE is to disclose the result of a predefined function over multiple ciphertexts, even if the ciphertexts were generated using different keys, while revealing nothing else about the data.</description>

      <description>We consider the problem of outsourcing computation on data authenticated by different users. Our aim is to describe and implement the simplest possible solution to provide data integrity in cloud-based scenarios. Concretely, our multi-key linearly homomorphic signature scheme (mklhs) allows users to upload signed data on a server, and at any later point in time any third party can query the server to compute a linear combination of data authenticated by different users and check the correctness of the returned result.</description>

      <description>As messaging applications are becoming increasingly popular, it is of utmost importance to analyze their security and mitigate existing weaknesses. This paper focuses on one of the most acclaimed messaging applications: Signal. Signal is a protocol that provides end-to-end channel security, forward secrecy, and post-compromise security. These features are achieved thanks to a key-ratcheting mechanism that updates the key material at every message. Due to its high security impact, Signal’s key-ratcheting has recently been formalized, along with an analysis of its security.</description>

      <description>Homomorphic authenticators (HAs) enable a client to authenticate a large collection of data elements m_1,&amp;hellip;,m_t and outsource them, along with the corresponding authenticators, to an untrusted server. At any later point, the server can generate a short authenticator sigma_(f,y) vouching for the correctness of the output y of a function f computed on the outsourced data, i.e., y = f(m_1,&amp;hellip;,m_t). Recently researchers have focused on HAs as a solution, with minimal communication and interaction, to the problem of delegating computation on outsourced data.</description>

      <description>Ridesharing is revolutionizing the transportation industry in many countries. Yet, the state of the art is based on heavily centralized services and platforms, where the service providers have full possession of the users’ location data. Recently, researchers have started addressing the challenge of enabling privacy-preserving ridesharing. The initial proposals, however, have shortcomings, as some rely on a central party, some incur high performance penalties, and most do not consider time preferences for ridesharing.</description>

      <description>We consider the problem of privacy-preserving processing of outsourced data in the context of user-customised services. Clients store their data on a server. In order to provide user-dependent services, service providers may ask the server to compute functions on the users’ data. We propose a new solution to this problem that guarantees data privacy (i.e., an honest-but-curious server cannot access plaintexts), as well as that service providers can correctly decrypt only –functions on– the data the user gave them access to (i.</description>

      <description>Multi-Key Homomorphic Signatures (MK-HS) enable clients in a system to sign and upload messages to an untrusted server. At any later point in time, the server can perform a computation C on data provided by t different clients, and return the output y and a short signature vouching for the correctness of y as the output of the function C on the signed data. Interestingly, MK-HS enable verifiers to check the validity of the signature using solely the public keys of the signers whose messages were used in the computation.</description>

      <title>Two-hop Distance-Bounding Protocols: Keep your Friends Close</title>

      <description>Distance-bounding (DB) protocols are cross-layer authentication protocols that are based on the round-trip-time of challenge-response exchanges and can be employed to guarantee physical proximity and combat relay attacks. However, traditional DB protocols rely on the assumption that the prover is in the communication range of the verifier, which might not be the case in multiple access control scenarios in ubiquitous computing environments or when we need to verify the proximity of our two-hop neighbour in an ad-hoc network.</description>

      <description>Authentication for resource-constrained devices is seen as one of the major challenges in current wireless communication networks. The HB+ protocol by Juels and Weis provides device authentication based on the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem and is appropriate for resource-constrained devices, but it has been shown to be vulnerable to a simple man-in-the-middle attack. Subsequent work has focused on modifying the cryptographic properties of the original protocol to mitigate this problem.</description>

      <description>Server-Aided Verification (SAV) is a method that can be em- ployed to speed up the process of verifying signatures by letting the verifier outsource part of its computation load to a third party. Achieving fast and reliable verification under the presence of an untrusted server is an attractive goal in cloud computing and internet of things scenarios. In this paper, we describe a simple framework for SAV where the interaction between a verifier and an untrusted server happens via a single-round protocol.</description>

      <description>Biometric Authentication Protocols (BAPs) have increasingly been employed to guarantee reliable access control to places and services. However, it is well-known that biometric traits contain sensitive information of individuals and if compromised could lead to serious security and privacy breaches. Yasuda et al. [23] proposed a distributed privacy-preserving BAP which Abidin et al. [1] have shown to be vulnerable to biometric template recovery attacks under the presence of a malicious computational server.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving biometric authentication: challenges and directions</title>

      <description>An emerging direction for authenticating people is the adoption of biometric authentication systems. Biometric credentials are becoming increasingly popular as a means of authenticating people due to the wide range of advantages that they provide with respect to classical authentication methods (e.g., password-based authentication). The most characteristic feature of this authentication method is the naturally strong bond between a user and her biometric credentials. This very same advantageous property, however, raises serious security and privacy concerns in case the biometric trait gets compromised.</description>

      <description>Distance-bounding protocols allow devices to cryptographically verify the physical proximity of two parties and is a prominent secure neighbour detection method. We describe how existing distance-bounding protocols could be modified to verify the proximity of both next-hop and two-hop neighbours. This approach allows a node to verify that another node is a physical next-hop neighbour, and also detects legitimate neighbours who make dishonest claims as to who their neighbours are. This approach could prevent dishonest neighbours from hoarding traffic as the result of advertising false two-hop routes.</description>

      <description>Authentication for resource-constrained devices is seen as one of the major challenges in current wireless communication networks.
The HB+ protocol performs device authentication based on the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem and simple computational steps, that renders it suitable for resource-constrained devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. However, it has been shown that the HB+ protocol as well as many of its variants are vulnerable to a simple man-in-the-middle attack.</description>

      <description>In biometric authentication protocols, a user is authenticated or granted access to a service if her fresh biometric trait matches the reference biometric template stored on the service provider. This matching process is usually based on a suitable distance which measures the similarities between the two biometric templates. In this paper, we prove that, when the matching process is performed using a specific family of distances (which includes distances such as the Hamming and the Euclidean distance), then information about the reference template is leaked.</description>

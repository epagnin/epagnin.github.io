# My Teaching Ethics

I believe that the main factors for great learning outcomes are: *trust* in the teacher and *engagement* of the students.
When interacting with students my philosophy is to do it all with enthusiasm, be available and remember that we are all learning from each other. 


# Master Thesis
Are you genuinely interested in cryptographic primitives and their applications to the real world? 
Contact me for doing a master thesis on this topic! I prefer theoretical master thesis to implementation-intensive one. 

# Advanced Web Security
I started teaching this course since the fall of 2020. 

<!-- OLD STUFF
As part of the teaching duties included in my PhD, I (co)supervise master theses and research projects. 
So far, I had the pleasure to follow these lovely master students in their works:

- Anders Stigsson: [A Taxonomy of Quantum Algorithms](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/255950/255950.pdf) (2018). 

- [Emilie Widegren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emeliewidegren): [Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Case Study](http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/256108-fully-homomorphic-encryption-a-case-study) (2017).

- [Elena Fuentes Bongenaar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-fuentes-bongenaar-92073663): multi-key homomorphic encryption [[report1](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/papers/Fully%20homomorphic%20encryption%20report.pdf),[report2](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/papers/Multi-key%20fully%20homomorphic%20encryption%20report.pdf)] (2016).

- [Jing Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jing-liu-5820a84a): [Verifiable Delegation of Computation in the Setting of Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/228386/228386.pdf) (2015) recently published at [CANS2017](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/publications.html#PLM17).

### On going projects: 
Lamiya Yagublu : *Investigating the Security of the Signal Protocol*.

# Lecturing and Teaching Assistant
## Academic Year 2017-2018:

**Algorithms TIN093/DIT602** (TA, exercise lectures, exams grading).

## Academic Year 2016-2017:
**Cryptography TDA352** (main lecturer, course responsable / grader and exam designer).
Here's a [9 minutes video on what crypto is all about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNC3jCCGJ0o) 
and a lovely paper that explains [Fiat-Shamir and Diffie-Hellman in rhymes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0059/8e6c76d943201f7ef320bf8c5134caaec395.pdf).  

Please check the slides and the exercise material uploaded on the course web-page.


## Academic Year 2015-2016:

**Cryptography TDA352** (TA, exercises and two lectures, exams grading). 
  Here you can find some recap slides about: 
   [CRT](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/CRT_recap.pdf), 
   [EEA](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/EEA_recap.pdf), 
   [ElGamal Encryption](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/ElGamal_recap.pdf), 
   [Hashes and Birthday Paradox](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/Hash&BP_recap.pdf), 
   [MAC](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/MACs_recap.pdf), 
   [PKE](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/PKE_recap.pdf), 
   [Primality Tests](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/PT_recap.pdf), 
   [RSA Encryption and Signature](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/RSA_recap.pdf), 
   [Secret Sharing and SMPC](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/ss_smpc_recap.pdf), 
   [ZK and Fiat Shamir protocol](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elenap/recap_slides/ZK_Fiat.pdf).


  If you find any errors in the slides, please let me know! I have already fixed the ones we saw during the lecture.

**DIT165 – Design and development of embedded systems** (exam grader).

**LEU481 – Programutveckling** (Lab TA).


## Academic Year 2014-2015:

**Technical writing** (papers reviewer).

**Programutveckling LEU 480** (Lab TA).

**Cryptography TDA351** (TA, frontal exercise sessions, one course lecture, exams grading).

**Development of Embedded Systems** (Lab TA).

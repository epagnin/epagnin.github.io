## Abstract
Distance-bounding protocols allow devices to cryptographically verify the physical proximity of two parties and is a
prominent secure neighbour detection method. 
We describe how existing distance-bounding protocols could be modified to verify
the  proximity  of  both  next-hop  and  two-hop  neighbours. 
This approach allows a node to verify that another node is a physical
next-hop  neighbour,  and  also  detects  legitimate  neighbours  who
make dishonest claims as to who their neighbours are. 
This approach could prevent dishonest neighbours from hoarding traffic
as the result of advertising false two-hop routes.

## Abstract

Authentication  for  resource-constrained  devices  is  seen  as
one of the major challenges in current wireless communication networks.  
The HB+ protocol performs device authentication based on the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem
and simple computational steps, that renders it suitable for resource-constrained devices such as
radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. 
However, it has been shown that the HB+ protocol as well as many of its variants are vulnerable
to a simple man-in-the-middle attack.  
We demonstrate that this attack could be mitigated using physical layer measures
from distance-bounding and simple modifications to devicesâ€™ radio receivers. 
Our hybrid solution (HB+DB) is shown to
provide both effective distance-bounding using a lightweight
HB+ -based  response  function,  and  resistance  against  the
man-in-the-middle attack to HB+. We provide experimental evaluation of our results as well as a brief discussion on
practical requirements for secure implementation.

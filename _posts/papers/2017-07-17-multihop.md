## Abstract

Several access control systems are based on the users’ physical location/proximity to the access point.   Distance-
Bounding (DB) protocols constitute a classical solution to calculate the distance between a trusted verifier (e.g., an access
point) and an untrusted prover (e.g., a pervasive device). The main limitation of DB is that the prover and the verifier need
to lie in each other’s communication range.  In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-Hop Distance-Estimation
(MHDE) protocols, which enable a verifier to authenticate a possibly far-away prover and estimate its distance to this
prover, when they are not in the communication range of each other, using an ad-hoc network of pervasive devices. More
precisely, our contributions are three-fold, since we provide:  (1) a formal definition for MHDE; (2) a threat model for
MHDE that considers a powerful and distributed adversary; and (3) implementation of MHDE protocols with different
settings.   Additionally,  we  demonstrate  our  protocol  to  be  secure  in  the  considered  threat  model,  and  we  provide  a
performance analysis regarding the accuracy of the distance estimation and the tolerance of limited mobility of the nodes.
The results are promising in order to adopt MHDE in a distributed setting.

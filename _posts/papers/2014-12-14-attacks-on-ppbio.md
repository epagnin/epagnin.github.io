## Abstract

Biometric authentication based on facial image, fingerprint,
palm print, iris, retina, or veins are becoming increasingly popular. 
However,compromised biometrictemplates,indeed,may lead to seriousthreats
to identity and their inherent irrevocability makes this risk even more
serious. Because of such serious privacy implications the need for
privacy-preserving  biometric  authentication  protocols is of utmost importance.
Recently, Yasuda et al. proposed two efficient privacy-preserving biometric authentication 
using packed homomorphic encryption based on ideal lattices and on ring learning with error. 
We review these protocols and analyse their security against malicious internal adversaries.

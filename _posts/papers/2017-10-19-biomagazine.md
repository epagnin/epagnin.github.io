## Abstract

An emerging direction for authenticating people is the adoption of biometric authentication systems. 
Biometric credentials are becoming increasingly popular as a means of authenticating people due to the wide range of advantages that they provide 
with respect to classical authentication methods (e.g., password-based authentication). 
The most characteristic feature of this authentication method is the naturally strong bond between a user and her biometric credentials. 
This very same advantageous property, however, raises serious security and privacy concerns in case the biometric trait gets compromised. 
In this article, we present the most challenging issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing secure and privacy-preserving biometric authentication protocols. 
More precisely, we describe the main threats against privacy-preserving biometric authentication systems 
and give directions on possible countermeasures in order to design secure and privacy-preserving biometric authentication protocols.

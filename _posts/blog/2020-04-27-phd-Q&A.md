This post contains some common Q&A for PhD students: 


## Q: Am I allowed to submit the same paper to multiple venues?
**A:** In general NO, not simultaneously. 
The large majority of the conferences and journals in our filed only accept original works (i.e., papers that do not have large overlap with existing work). 
If your paper is rejected from venue1, of course you can submit (an improved version) to venue2, after you receive the final notification of rejection. 
**Always read the call for papers (CFP) in detail**, especially if you are a novice. 
There are a few exceptions: some journals, local conferences without proceedings and workshops accept works that have already been published or 'full version' (usually at least 25% new material) of existing publications.

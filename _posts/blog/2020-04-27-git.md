## Handy links for GIT

Git is an amazing tool for collaborative projects. 
In a nutshell, it enables version controlling of whatever collection of digital you log in it. 
When writing a paper with other people, it makes it easy to trace changes, ensure everyone can reach the most recent version of the text / code / experiments, and revert back in time to restore previous versions, if needed. 
As a PhD student, if you want to do research with me, knowing how to navigate git is a prerequisite. 

There are several guides available on google as well as youtube tutorials. 
Find the ones that works best for you! 

Here's a couple of links (feel free to PM me with better and more up to date suggestions!)

- [Quick Start Guide to Git](https://dev.to/tauag/quick-start-guide-to-git-2of5)
- [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

You are more than welcome to control the git report from the command line ;-) but, should you at some point want to use a GUI, [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is a great one (for mac and windows)

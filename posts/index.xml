      <description>How did I build this website? For academics, I think having a personal website is quite important as it allows you to quickly advertise news, collect and organize your work, and, most importantly, it is a great way for everyone around the world to know you exist and what you&amp;rsquo;re up to.
For several years I have used jekyll, but it started to get messy with the latest OS updates and gem versions.</description>

      <description>Handy links for GIT Git is an amazing tool for collaborative projects. In a nutshell, it enables version controlling of whatever collection of digital data you log in it. When writing a paper with other people, git makes it easy to trace changes, to ensure everyone can reach the most recent version of the text / code / experiments, and, if needed, to revert back in time to restore previous versions.</description>

      <description>This post contains some common Q&amp;amp;A for PhD students:
Q: Where can I look for papers to read and study? A: In the beginning of your PhD, start by looking at the list of accepted papers at top- and mid-level conferences. You can do this by googling the conference name, a year and search for a link of &amp;lsquo;accepted papers&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;program&amp;rsquo;. [Names of conferences: CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, PKC, Theory of Cryptography Conference] Some conferences also provide video recordings of the presentations (which is a time-efficient way to get what the paper is about).</description>

      <title>What is Cryptography?</title>

      <description>What is Cryptography? If you are working with me, chances are that we stumble upon some cryptographic primitive, security proof, or privacy challenge. In order to have fruitful discussion, it is very important that you get an understanding of the general framework used in cryptography, how primitives are formalised and how to reason about security model, attackers and proofs.
There is a gazillion of good resources available on the world wide web on these topics.</description>

      <description>Mentoring videos by the IACR community The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) launched a initiative to provide advice for researchers in early stages (students and junior faculty) and women researchers in the area of cryptography. In this serie of videos you can listen to the answers a pool of community members gives to a wide range of questions, most of which you will stumble upon at a certain point in your academic carier.</description>

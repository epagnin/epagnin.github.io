    <h1 id="how-to-determine-quality-of-papers">How to determine quality of papers</h1>
<p>There are different metrics to <em>measure</em> &lsquo;how good&rsquo; a paper is. None is perfect or completely accurate. The best way to judge is personal, and you will develop your own preferences and &lsquo;qualities indicators&rsquo; over time.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (<a href="https://sfdora.org/read/">DORA</a>) opens with this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There is a pressing need to improve the ways in which the output of scientific research is evaluated by funding agencies, academic institutions, and other parties.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why some organizations (listed blow) provide rankings that are meant to evaluate research in a fair way according to some criteria. Unfotrnatly a single criteria cannot measure and assess quality in a coherent way across different disciplines, communities, eras, topics.</p>
<h2 id="common-rankings-for-references">Common rankings for references</h2>
<p>For starters, you can follow guidelines about the quality of the venue where a work is accepted for publications.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CORE ranking:</strong>
<a href="http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/?search=&amp;by=all&amp;source=CORE2021&amp;sort=atitle&amp;page=1">COmparing Research &amp; Education</a> (Australian Conference Portal Ranking) follows <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zIraYjVQZLlRFiR3g9RSWKCCK4Hv-Ide/view">DORA criteria</a> and is my personal favoirite (though it does not include <em>many nice</em> venues we have within cryptography)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> has a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_computersecuritycryptography">ranking of security conferences</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not aware of an official ranking for venues within cryptography (if you are, please let me know!), and especially within cryptographic protocols and applications. So I made a <a href="/deadlines">collection of venues</a> I like and provide rakings according to my personal experience + CORE (when available).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-metrics">Common metrics</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that people like simplistic statements. This means that they will pick a metric and use it to compare people/works and assess quality of research. However, no matter what matric you choose, it will not be compeltey accurate and fair (especially if you attempt to compare researchers/papers from neighbouring fields). This is because any metric will compress a complex, multi-dimensional data (e.g., venue quality, number of citations, number of total publications, number of authors, reviewers&rsquo; expertise&hellip;) into a single value, which of course simplifies things, but at the same time loses important factors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>number of publications</strong>: the more the marrier! But keep in mind that if having <em>too many</em> publications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is an index of either geniality, or (most commonly) that little or no contribution comes from that author in each work. Too little publications (esepcially per-year publications) may mean unproductivity or simply a bad luck with reviewer 2 ðŸ˜‘</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>number of citations</strong>: intuitively, the more one paper is cited, the more it is known in the community. One may wish this would imply that higly cited works/researchers are the <em>strogest</em>, but keep in mind that actually many most cited papers are surveys, systematic organization of knowledge, <em>broken constructions</em> and <em>attacks</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>h-index</strong>: is defined as the maximum value of <code>h</code> such that the given author/journal has published at least <code>h</code> papers that have each been cited at least <code>h</code> times. The index is designed to improve upon simpler measures such as the total number of citations or publications. One&rsquo;s h-index is important &ldquo;in general&rdquo; but it does not always accurately capture the quality of one&rsquo;s research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>h-index</strong> for events: attempts to transfer the quality/impact of the event (conference / journal) to the individuals publishing there. Keep in mind that h-indexes tend to indicate the popularity of a topics rather than the quality of a work. Moreover h-indexes enforc positive loops: if something goes up in ranking, then more poeple are willing to send their good work there, which improves the quality of works accepted, and in turns increases the h-index value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>i10-Index</strong> is defined as the number of publications with at least 10 citations.<br>
This very simple measure is only used by Google Scholar to help gauge the productivity of researchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>impact factor</strong> (IF): measures the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>corner cases</strong>: in cryptography, core theoretical results are often of higher quality than many applied secuity papers. But doing theory is hard so you don&rsquo;t see as much follow up work on that (and thus, less citations and publications of this nature are spread across years). Sometimes a paper becomes &lsquo;popular&rsquo; just because is was written at the right time and got momentum (citation/visibility) quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Google Scholar ranking is based on h-index and is skewed towards security and applications rather than core crypto. As of now (July 2022), I do not agree much with this ranking for my own research field.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>How many is <em>too many</em> publications, depends on one&rsquo;s field of research and career stage. Within crypography, I&rsquo;d say that for PhD students a good average is 1-2 papers / year, for Post Docs is 2-4/year, and for Professors 2-5/years.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

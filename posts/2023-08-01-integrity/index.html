    <h2 id="integrity-in-academia">Integrity in Academia</h2>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> is crucial in academic line of work: you need to make sure that what you publish is <em>sound</em>, and that you are able to <em>defend any aspect of your work</em>, even the parts that have been developed by your collaborators and co-authors.</p>
<p>It is also very important to objectively and respectfully <strong>recognize the source of ideas</strong>. Many times you end up re-discovering an existing wheel, though you made the effort &ldquo;independently&rdquo; if someone else published or publicly discussed it before you, the &ldquo;seminal idea&rdquo; should be awarded to them.</p>
<p>Integrity and fair attribution of contribution may seem obvious moral pillars, however there have been clamorous cases when these pillars have been maliciously ignored, which led to <strong>catastrophic consequences</strong> for the perpetrators and a tsunami ripple effect to whole line of research. For the possible most epic case, watch this very instructive youtube video by Bobby Broccoli about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDoml-Db64">the man who almost faked his way to a Nobel Prize</a>.</p>

      <description>How did I build this website? For academics, I think having a personal website is quite important as it allows you to quickly advertise news, collect and organize your work, and, most importantly, it is a great way for everyone around the world to know you exist and what you&amp;rsquo;re up to.
For several years I have used jekyll, but it started to get messy with the latest OS updates and gem versions.</description>

      <description>Handy links for GIT Git is an amazing tool for collaborative projects. In a nutshell, it enables version controlling of whatever collection of digital data you log in it. When writing a paper with other people, git makes it easy to trace changes, to ensure everyone can reach the most recent version of the text / code / experiments, and, if needed, to revert back in time to restore previous versions.</description>

      <description>This post contains some common Q&amp;amp;A for PhD students:
Q: Am I allowed to submit the same paper to multiple venues? A: In general NO, not simultaneously. The large majority of the conferences and journals in our filed only accept original works (i.e., papers that do not have large overlap with existing work). If your paper is rejected from venue1, of course you can submit (an improved version) to venue2, after you receive the final notification of rejection.</description>

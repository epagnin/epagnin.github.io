      <description>Basics principles of peer-reviewing You submit your work. A few people read it, usually the magic number of reviewers is 3 and they are supposed to be experts in the topic of your paper. These people say what they think about your paper. Your paper gets accepted or rejecting according to the reviewers&amp;rsquo; opinions and possibly a sanity check by the general chair of the conference.
What do reviewers look for in a paper?</description>

      <title>How to determine quality of papers</title>

      <description>How to determine quality of papers There are different metrics to measure &amp;lsquo;how good&amp;rsquo; a paper is. None is perfect or completely accurate. The best way to judge is personal, and you will develop your own preferences and &amp;lsquo;qualities indicators&amp;rsquo; over time.
The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) opens with this statement:
There is a pressing need to improve the ways in which the output of scientific research is evaluated by funding agencies, academic institutions, and other parties.</description>

      <description>How did I build this website? For academics, I think having a personal website is quite important as it allows you to quickly advertise news, collect and organize your work, and, most importantly, it is a great way for everyone around the world to know you exist and what you&amp;rsquo;re up to.
For several years I have used jekyll, but it started to get messy with the latest OS updates and gem versions.</description>

      <description>Handy links for GIT Git is an amazing tool for collaborative projects. In a nutshell, it enables version controlling of whatever collection of digital data you log in it. When writing a paper with other people, git makes it easy to trace changes, to ensure everyone can reach the most recent version of the text / code / experiments, and, if needed, to revert back in time to restore previous versions.</description>

      <description>The body of literature around cryptographic techniques and provable security is enormous. To help new-comers approach the community I am collecting a list of nice papers that hopefully provide an easy introduction to the main branches of cryptography and the way formal reasoning works.
. AnoA: A framework for analyzing anonymous communication protocols by Backes et al. In IEEE 26th Computer Security Foundations Symposium 2013 Jun 26 (pp. 163-178).
This is a great paper to understand how to reason about and formalize security notions around anonymity in communication protocols.</description>

Tools to help you visualize size of things When numbers are so big that it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to get an understanding of their magnitude some resources might come handy: the mesure of things to compare the quantity to other more-or-less well-known things; or numbermatics to get facts on the number itself.</description>

      <description>This post contains some common Q&amp;amp;A for PhD students:
Q: Where can I look for papers to read and study? A: In the beginning of your PhD, start by looking at the list of accepted papers at top- and mid-level conferences. You can do this by googling the conference name, a year and search for a link of &amp;lsquo;accepted papers&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;program&amp;rsquo;. [Names of conferences: CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, PKC, Theory of Cryptography Conference] Some conferences also provide video recordings of the presentations (which is a time-efficient way to get what the paper is about).</description>

      <description>Tipps for Good Teaching Practice As part of your PhD education at LTH, you will take some pedagogical courses regarding teaching, learning and how to evaluate students&amp;rsquo; learning. But when it comes to it, how do you structure a lecture? Here and here you can find a list of clear and valuable pointers to keep in mind when preparing yourself to this task.</description>

      <description>What is Cryptography? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick video explaining the magic you can do with cryptography.
If you are working with me, chances are that we stumble upon some cryptographic primitive, security proof, or privacy challenge. In order to have fruitful discussion, it is very important that you get an understanding of the general framework used in cryptography, how primitives are formalised and how to reason about security model, attackers and proofs.</description>

      <description>Mentoring videos by the IACR community The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) launched a initiative to provide advice for researchers in early stages (students and junior faculty) and women researchers in the area of cryptography. In this serie of videos you can listen to the answers a pool of community members gives to a wide range of questions, most of which you will stumble upon at a certain point in your academic carier.</description>

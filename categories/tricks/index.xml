      <description>Technical Swedish Living and working in Sweden one can go by a long way with using just English. However, now and then comes the time when you are asked to provide a summary of your talk/thesis/work/grant proposal in Swedish. The usual workflow is to write a good piece of text in English, run it via google translator or chatGPT, but then, human-intelligence is needed to handle odd translation of terms that are rarely (if ever) used in Swedish.</description>

      <description>How did I build this website? For academics, I think having a personal website is quite important as it allows you to quickly advertise news, collect and organize your work, and, most importantly, it is a great way for everyone around the world to know you exist and what you&amp;rsquo;re up to.
For several years I have used jekyll, but it started to get messy with the latest OS updates and gem versions.</description>

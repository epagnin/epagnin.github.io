     <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>The problem of securely outsourcing the computation of a bilinear pairing has been widely investigated in the literature. Designing an eï¬€icient protocol with the desired functionality has, however, been an open challenge for a long time. Recently, Di Crescenzo et al. (CARDISâ€™20) proposed the first suite of protocols for securely and eï¬€iciently delegating pairings with online inputs under the presence of a malicious server. We progress along this path with the aim of LOVE (Lowering the cost of Outsourcing and Verifying Eï¬€iciently) a pairing. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a protocol (LOVE) that improves the eï¬€iciency of Di Crescenzo et al.â€™s proposal for securely delegating pairings with online, public inputs. Second, we provide the first implementation of eï¬€icient protocols in this setting. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our LOVE protocol in different application scenarios by benchmarking an implementation using BN, BLS12 and BLS24 pairing-friendly curves. Interestingly, compared to Di Crescenzo et al.â€™s protocol, LOVE is up to 29.7% faster for the client, up to 24.9% for the server and requires 23- 24% less communication cost depending on the choice of parameters. Furthermore, we note that our LOVE protocol is especially suited for subgroup-secure groups: checking the correctness of the delegated pairing requires up to 56.2% less computations than evaluating the pairing locally (no delegation). This makes LOVE the most eï¬€icient protocol to date for securely outsourcing the computation of a pairing with online public inputs, even when the server is malicious.The problem of securely outsourcing the computation of a bilinear pairing has been widely investigated in the literature.
